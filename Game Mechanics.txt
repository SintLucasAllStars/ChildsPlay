if you are seen then the enemy will come after you if the enemy touches you then you die and have to start over(tag).
if the enemy sees you then you have to hide for 3 seconds where the enemy doesnt see you.
there are 3 enemys in the level that roam around in a small level.
the end point is indecated with a light beam that you have to look for.
